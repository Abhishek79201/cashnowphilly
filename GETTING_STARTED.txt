GETTING STARTED IN 5 MINUTES
=============================

This is a quick start guide to get your Cash Now Philly landing page running locally.

⚡ PREREQUISITES
===============
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Node.js 18 or higher installed (check with: node -v)
- A Google account (for Google Sheets)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Terminal/Command Prompt access

📋 STEP-BY-STEP SETUP
=====================

STEP 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)
-----------------------------------------
Open terminal in the project folder and run:

npm install

This will install all required packages (Next.js, React, TypeScript, etc.)


STEP 2: Setup Google Sheets (3 minutes)
----------------------------------------
We need a place to save form submissions:

A. Create a Google Sheet:
   1. Go to sheets.google.com
   2. Create a new blank spreadsheet
   3. Name it "Cash Now Philly Leads"
   4. Add these headers in row 1:
      Timestamp | Address | Phone Number | Source | User Agent | IP

B. Get Service Account Credentials:
   1. Go to console.cloud.google.com
   2. Create a new project (or use existing)
   3. Enable "Google Sheets API"
   4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "Service Account"
   5. Create service account and download JSON key
   
C. Share Sheet with Service Account:
   1. Open the JSON key file you downloaded
   2. Copy the "client_email" value
   3. Go back to your Google Sheet
   4. Click "Share" and paste the email
   5. Give it "Editor" access

D. Get Spreadsheet ID:
   1. Look at your Google Sheet URL
   2. Copy the ID between /d/ and /edit
   Example: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123.../edit
   The ID is: ABC123...


STEP 3: Setup Environment Variables (1 minute)
-----------------------------------------------
A. Copy the example file:

Windows:
copy .env.example .env

Mac/Linux:
cp .env.example .env

B. Open .env in your code editor and fill in:

GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=
   Paste the Spreadsheet ID from Step 2D

GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=
   From JSON key file, the "client_email" value

GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=
   From JSON key file, the "private_key" value
   Important: Keep the quotes and \n characters as-is!

NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONE_NUMBER=8669719529
   Your phone number (digits only)

NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONE_DISPLAY=(866) 971-9529
   How you want the phone number displayed

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   For development, use localhost
   For production, use your real domain


STEP 4: Add Basic Assets (1 minute)
------------------------------------
Create the assets folder:

mkdir public\assets   (Windows)
mkdir -p public/assets   (Mac/Linux)

For now, you can use placeholder images or download from the original site.
See ASSETS_REQUIRED.txt for the complete list.

Required files:
- public/assets/cashnowphilly-logo.png
- public/favicon.ico

Other images can be added later - the site will still run without them.


STEP 5: Run Development Server (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------
Start the server:

npm run dev

Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000

You should see your landing page! 🎉


✅ TEST THE FORM
================
1. Fill out the property address and phone number
2. Click "Get a Cash Offer"
3. Check your Google Sheet - you should see a new row!


🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

"Module not found" error:
→ Run: npm install

Form doesn't submit:
→ Check Google Sheets credentials in .env
→ Make sure service account has access to sheet
→ Check browser console for error messages

Images not showing:
→ Verify images are in /public/assets/
→ Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

Port 3000 already in use:
→ Run: npm run dev -- -p 3001
   (This uses port 3001 instead)


📚 NEXT STEPS
=============

Now that it's running:

1. Read SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt for detailed configuration
2. Add all required images (see ASSETS_REQUIRED.txt)
3. Customize colors and content in components
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Set up tracking (GTM, Google Ads)
6. Build for production: npm run build
7. Deploy (see DEPLOYMENT.txt)


🎯 DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
=======================

Making changes:
1. Edit files in app/ or components/
2. Save the file
3. Browser auto-refreshes with changes
4. No need to restart server!

Before deploying:
1. Test form submission
2. Check all links work
3. Test on mobile
4. Run: npm run build
5. Fix any errors
6. Run: npm start to test production build


💡 TIPS
=======

- Keep the development server running while you work
- Changes to components refresh automatically
- Changes to .env require server restart (Ctrl+C then npm run dev)
- Use browser DevTools to inspect and debug
- Check the Network tab to see API requests
- Console will show any JavaScript errors


🆘 NEED HELP?
=============

Check these files:
- SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.txt - Detailed setup guide
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.txt - How the code is organized
- DEPLOYMENT.txt - How to deploy to production

Common commands:
npm run dev       Start development server
npm run build     Build for production
npm start         Run production build
npm install       Install dependencies


🎊 YOU'RE READY!
================

Your landing page is now running locally. Make changes, test the form, and when ready, follow DEPLOYMENT.txt to publish it to the web.

Happy coding! 🚀
